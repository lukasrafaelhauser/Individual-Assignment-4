  #  In this exercise we will create an HTTP server to which we can upload a
  # graph and in which we can get the degrees of separation between two nodes
  #in the graph.
  #1. Create a route in the server to which the user can upload a graph using
  # JSON and using the POST http method. The JSON data should be
#passed as part of the request body, not in the URL.
#2. Create a route to get the degrees of separation between two nodes in
#the previously uploaded graph.
#localhost:5000/degrees_of_separation/<origin>/<destination>.
#You can use any code we want from the exercises weâ€™ve done in class
#related to graphs.
